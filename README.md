# react-native-grpc
### CAUTION: UNDER DEVELOPMENT
The current version of react-native-grpc is an earlier version picked from our internal code tree, has very basis functions, support UNARY call only(Streaming call should works, but haven't tested). We use modified gRPC Objc to provide more features we need, and we're working on make it open source.
